Hi, I'm Joriel! I'm an ameture webdev & aspiring front-end software dev. I've never taken any type of coding class in my life and my spaghetti code is evidence of that. 
Everything I know comes from my pre-adolescent internet adventures and decorating my online profiles for websites like oldschool deviantart, tumblr, etc with a big mess of code
just to make my page look cool. To this day, I still find a specific kind of allure from that messy aesthetic of 2000s webdev, so i'm starting from that angle and working my way up.

I push myself to learn a little more every day -- mainly focusing on the basics of html and css -- and aim to get better one bit at a time. I plan to just kinda dump my projects here
and keep moving along as I get more ideas. I'm not an incredibly social person, but if you happen to stumble across my page, constructive crictisim is genuinely appreciated. Despite
my web pages looking like visual vomit from 2007, I DO actually aim to improve my web skills.
