Hi, I'm Joriel! I am an ameture webdev, and ultimately aspiring to be a front-end software dev and/or engineer. As of now, I have never taken any type of coding class in my life and my spaghetti code is evidence of that. Everything I know comes from my adolescent internet adventures and decorating my online profiles for websites like oldschool deviantart, tumblr, etc. with a big mess of code just to make my page look cool. To this day, I still find a specific kind of allure from that messy aesthetic of 2000's webdev, so I'm starting from that angle and working my way up.

I push myself to learn a little more every day-- mainly focusing on the basics of html and CSS-- and aim to get better one bit at a time. I plan to just kinda dump my projects here and keep moving along as I get more ideas. I am not an incredibly social person, but if you happen to stumble across my page, constructive crictisim is genuinely appreciated. Despite some of my projects looking like visual vomit from 2007, I DO actually aim to improve my web skills.
